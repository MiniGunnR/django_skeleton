# Django Skeleton
Personal django project structure built using Python and Django's templates.

This script requires Django. So create a virtualenv and install the requirements.txt file with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

After that run the script with two arguments, the first one should be the name of the project and the second one should be the name of an app.

So if you want a project named `demo` and an app named `blog`, you should create it with `python script.py demo blog`.
